// Java Source and Class Directories
The source directory is often called src, but this is not a requirement. For instance if you use the build tool Maven then you will typically use a different directory structure, where the Java source code is stored in the src/main/java directory (under the root directory of your project)

// compile java file
javac src/mypackage/*.java -d classes

// execute class file
java -cp classes mypackage.MyClass
