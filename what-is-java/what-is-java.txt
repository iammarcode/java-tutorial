- Java Language
Java files are stored in files suffixed with ".java".

- Java Bytecode
Java files(xxx.java) are then compiled into Java byte code using the Java compiler.

- Java Virtual Machine
JVM is a program itself. The byte code is then executed using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- Standard Java APIs
These APIs enable your Java programs to access the local file system, the network and many other things.
The standard Java APIs come bundled with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
JRE is the JVM + standard Java APIs.
The JRE contains enough to execute a Java application, but not to compile it.

- Java Software Development Kit (SDK)
JRE + compiler
.java files -> .class files.

- Java Code Conventions
The Java Code Conventions are a set of conventions for how to format your Java code, and how to name classes, variables, files etc.

- Java has evolved into three different sets of APIs(https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/index.html):
Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)
Java Embedded
Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
